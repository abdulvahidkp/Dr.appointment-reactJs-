# Doctor Appointment Frontend

This project is a frontend implementation of a doctor appointment application, built using ReactJS with Vite bundler. The application allows users to navigate through different routes, such as the homepage, blog page, about page, contact page, signup page, and signin page.

The project also utilizes `react-router-dom` for navigation, and `tailwindcss` for styling, providing an enhanced user experience.
